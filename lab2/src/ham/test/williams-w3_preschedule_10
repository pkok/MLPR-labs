Subject: MID C schedule going real-time


There is a 25 mw light load schedule that Aquila Canada is generating and AVA sinks at there system.   The schedule is going real-time because Aquila reported the transmission incorrectly to BPA transmission group.  We bought from Aquila Deal # 508908.1 and sold to WWP Deal # 162508.1.  Please refer to Aquila tag numbers #167799 and #167797.  Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out.  

Thanks,
Stacy
