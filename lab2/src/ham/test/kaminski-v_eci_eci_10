Mike,

Vince and I are eager to see if our group can play a role in helping you in 
your development work using some combination of the OR experts in our group 
and the resources to which we have access at Stanford.  

Can we get together for a short planning session when you are next in 
Houston?  Please let me know your schedule, or have your assistant coordinate 
a time with Vince's assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (x35290).

Thanks,

Stinson
