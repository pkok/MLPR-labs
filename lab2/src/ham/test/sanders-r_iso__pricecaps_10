Greetings:
As many of you are aware the EOB has filed a subpoena with the ISO requiring
them to provide confidential market data.
Jan knows that there may be people planning on filing an injunction of this
requirement and wanted to communicate that he thought this was a bad idea
and that there were other legal means to provide the protection you are
looking for to maintain the confidentially.
 If you have any questions regarding this please call Jan on his cell phone
at 916-296-8584.  If you are planning to file an injunction please call Jan
ASAP to let him know.
Thanks,
Katie Kaplan
