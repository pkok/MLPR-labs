Subject: Re: Weights? nice.

Hey. I saw this sunrise from my place this morning. Granted it didn't look as cool as it probably did from up here, but it was pretty sweet. It was so orange and pinkish. I wasn't here too late last night which ruled. Yeah, I went to Bally's and did the cross country machine and the stairmaster. Funny. I look like such a retard on those machines, but anyways. I guess that place it ok, but I just feel really self-conscious when I am there. At the  gym in Houston I just felt more at ease or something. I wanted to go into the free weight area to do some lunges and tricep work last night, but the meatheads scared me off. It was pretty lame I admit, but what can I say? Anyhoo, coffee sounds good to me as it usually does. Let me know when is good for you (maybe 9ish).
