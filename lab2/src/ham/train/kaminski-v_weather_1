Iris
I would like you to put me in contact with s/one at  here in London that
deals with Weather Derivatives and would be in a position to sell us options on
weather derivatives (temperature, cat). Let me know if you are able to do that
or if I need to work internally here in order to find out whom we have contacts
with at .
If you want to call me my direct line is +44 207 336-2836. Alternatively I could
call you but do bear in mind that I leave the office around 6:30 -7pm London
time. Send me an email and let me know when is a good time to talk and I will
call you back.
Thanks in advance.
Antonella
