Subject: Re: Joint Probabilities

The updated probabilities are attached.  The probability of reaching any Fx 
times RAB multiple are the same as the original analysis.  The probabilities 
of reaching a given stock price are lower than the original analysis in both 
the optimistic and pessimistic cases because the debt levels are higher, and 
hence the stock value is lower for any Fx-RAB value.
