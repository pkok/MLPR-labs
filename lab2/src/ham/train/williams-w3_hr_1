Subject:  Elves Update

Hello all!

Thanks again to everyone who participated in our  Elves Event! We were able to provide each family a number of gifts for the children as well as a gift certificate to Fred Meyer.

We will be holding the drawing for the Blazer tickets next Monday (January 7th), when more employees are likely to be present. For your reference, here is some additional information about the games:

Package 1:	Blazers vs. Cleveland Cavaliers
		Sunday, January 13th - 7:00 pm
		4 tickets in the lower level, parking included

Package 2:	Blazers vs. Minnesota Timberwolves
		Wednesday, March 6th - 7:00 pm
		4 tickets in the lower level, parking included

If you donated money or a gift and were not able to enter your name into the drawing, please us know--we would be more than happy to add your name.  

Also, we have requested receipts from the Salvation Army for the cash donations that were received. If you would like a receipt for your donation, please contact Grace directly. 

PLEASE NOTE: Many employees who are no longer with the company took part in our  Elves efforts. Recognizing their contributions, we will be including them in the drawing.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks!
The  Elves Team
