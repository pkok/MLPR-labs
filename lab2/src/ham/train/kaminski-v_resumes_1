Subject: Meeting follow-up


Dear Vince,
I enjoyed very much meeting you at the EPRM  conference.  
As agreed, I am attaching both my resume and  the paper on my dissertation work, which I will be presenting at the Real  Options Conference in UCLA next month.  I would be delighted to have your  comments and impressions on it.
If it is of interest to you, I would also be  very enthusiastic about exploring together different powerful  ways of applying these concepts at .
 
Early congratulations on your son's graduation; let  me know if you come to the Bay Area soon.
Best regards,
