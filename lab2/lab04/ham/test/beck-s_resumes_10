Subject: Resume - Jasmine Master Katrak

Toni -

Sally suggested I forward this resume to you.  Jasmine got in touch with me 
through a mutual friend.  I don't know much about her business potential or 
past performance.  She is currently a contract employee at El Paso and is 
concerned that with the Coastal merger, she will be out of a job.

On a completely selfish note, I will be asking for your support if we hire 
Jasmine to collect my $$$ from HR.

Regards,
Gary Taylor

Dear Mr. Taylor:

Per our conversation, I would like to apply for a suitable position in the
Risk Management division.

Since PG&E relocated to Bethesda, MD, I went to work as a contract employee
with El Paso Merchant Energy. Due to the merger of El Paso with
Coastal/Engage, my days are pretty much numbered at El Paso.

I have enclosed my resume for your review.

I thank you for your time and thoughtfulness.

Sincerely,
Jasmine
(713) 420-6735
