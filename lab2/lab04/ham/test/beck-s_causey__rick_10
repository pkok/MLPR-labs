Subject: Subject Line: Revision to Approach for October 18 Offsite

We have decided to do more information gathering and analysis prior to 
pulling the group together for the kickoff meeting that was planned for 
October 18.  Please complete the materials that were requested, and return 
them to Jan Johnson by October 18.  Working with a few others, including 
business unit representatives, over the next few weeks, Jan will 

review what's been prepared 
meet with key reporting personnel in each BU to further understand each BU's 
information needs
identify similarities, differences, opportunities for improvement, etc.
interview CAOs and others to review findings and discuss what additional 
information needs exist that are not currently being met
prepare a proposed approach for how the teams will proceed

At that time we will get together the larger group to agree on how the teams 
should proceed.  So the meeting on October 18th is postponed until further 
notice.   Please contact me if you have any suggestions or questions.  Thanks!

For your convenience, here are the files with the information to be returned 
to Jan.
