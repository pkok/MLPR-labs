Subject: RE: Out of the Office - March 2 and March 5

Have a good vacation.

 I talked to Rahil and he is going to focus a significant amount of his time 
with your team, from an origination perspective, on what you and I discussed 
yesterday.  We are also dedicating an analyst full time, that works for Marc 
Eichman in structuring, to work with Rahil and your team on getting the 
business plan and modeling completed for commercialization.

I am seeing Tom Gros today at 3 PM to discuss with him what I discussed with 
you yesterday.

Can we meet again this Thursday with you, your commercialization team and 
Rahil, Marc and the analyst to agree on what we want to accomplish in the 
next week or so?

Let me know your thoughts.

Subject: Out of the Office - March 2 and March 5

I will be out of the office on vacation on Friday, March 2 and Monday, March 
5.  I will check messages at the end of both business days.  My assistant, 
Patti Thompson ( x35926) will have contact numbers for me.  Since I will be a 
chaperone for my daughter and 80 other girls from the high school drill team 
at state competition in Dallas, it is unlikely that I will be easily 
reachable during the day.  

I will be back in the office on Tuesday, March 6.
