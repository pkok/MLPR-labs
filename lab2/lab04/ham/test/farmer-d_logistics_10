Subject: RE: Centana Storage Deal

Rita,

Stephen and I have been working on this matter.  We are getting the contracts and counter parties activated so they can be pathed for September 2001.  I talked to Stephen this morning and he is working with global to get the counter parties active.

Thanks.

Mike

Mike/Stephen,

Have the two of you been able to get the deal in for the sale of the Centana storage to AEP?  Please advise.  I would like to have this completed for this close if possible.

Daren - if you are not aware of this transaction, please let me know.  Thanks!
