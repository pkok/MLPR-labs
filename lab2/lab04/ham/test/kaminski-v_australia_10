Hi Vince,

I sent the attached  for 's approval to Fiona Grant, but haven't heard
back. In the  contract that we signed it states that we need to seek
approval from   if we want to use the company name. Is there someone
else we should direct  these requests?

Hope you are well.

Julie

Fiona,

I've attached a letter that is going to be sent  out to some? universities,
promoting the Energy Derivative book. Are  we allowed to? mention, "...in
association with  Corp."? Please  see attached.

Should we check with you every time we would like to use  " Corp." when
advertising the book? It will usually follow similar  format.

Thanks,
Julie
