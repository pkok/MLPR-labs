Subject: DPR - 8/23/00

The DPR for today is final and posted to the Executive Reports Viewer.

Please note that a revision to the DPR format has been made, effective today, 
due to a change in organizational structure.  The " North America, 
Emerging Businesses" section, which includes Pulp & Paper Trading and Lumber, 
has been removed and replaced by the " Industrial Markets" section.
