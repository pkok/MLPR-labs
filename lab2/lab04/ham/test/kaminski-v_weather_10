Christian,

Just finished meeting with Pual, Vince & Mark

New Plan:

Let's plan on your coming to Houston March 12th - April 2nd (after our 
summer/winters respectively

BUT..

 let's proceed with the project without pause:

 1. please send up the software that needs to be installed along with 
operating system requirements

 2. please copy me on forecasting provided to Sydney office on a daily basis

if we work on these two fronts, it will optimize your time here and permit 
transotion to cover your forecasting there


Thanks

- - -  Mike
