Subject: RE: London contact number

Hi Anita,

 How are you?  I arrived yesterday late morning from the London Gatwick 
airport.  Due to rush hour traffic, etc. it took a while to get into the city 
to the hotel.

 Also, due to May Day (May 1st) protests/riots, etc., the hotel management 
strongly recommended that we remain in the hotel.  

 However, I am in the office today.  I can be reached via email or via 
telephone at 44 (0) 207 783 5647.

Take care,
Iris

See Iris's itinerary below.  I thought her initial plan was to land this 
morning and come in to  House in early afternoon.  See itinerary for 
phone number of hotel.  Let me know if I can help in any
other way.  Thanks.  Anita
