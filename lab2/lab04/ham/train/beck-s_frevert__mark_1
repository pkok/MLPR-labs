Subject: Junior Achievement

On Wednesday, April 11, 2001, , in conjunction with Junior Achievement, will host 40 students from Westside High School and Kerr High School for a day of Job Shadowing.  This program's objectives are to demonstrate why a sound education, interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic are needed to be successful in the workplace.

The Job Shadowing program consists of the following:

	8:45 AM		Students arrive
	9:00 - 10:30 AM	Welcome, Overview, Video, and Tours
	10:30 - 12:00 N	Individual Job Shadow Experience with  Employees
	12:00 - 1:00 PM	Student Lunch with Closing Comments
	1:00 PM		Students return to schools

We need your assistance in identifying individuals within your area who would be available to assist with the job shadowing experience.  Please contact Nicki Daw ASAP with your recommendations.  More detailed information will be supplied to the employees assisting.

Thank you for your support of the /Junior Achievement Job Shadowing program.
