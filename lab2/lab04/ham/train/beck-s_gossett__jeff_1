Subject: Wellhead Desk - New Headcount

This week, the wellhead desk has done more than 150 deals.  We need to discuss adding a headcount (maybe 2),  as originally we were just integrating the book with the daily business.  At the current pace,  this is no longer an option.  Bob,  will this require an additional headcount for logistics as well?  And,  who needs to sign off on this on the commercial side?

Thanks for your help,

JG
