Subject: Risk Desk, Issue #1

Hello--Listen, wanted to make sure you received a copy of our newest publication last week, The Risk Desk. Because of the size of the files we sent out, quite a few bounced back because some corp firewalls halt emails over a certain size. Anyhow, if you didn't receive the issue, hit the reply button and type "resend Risk Desk." Responce so far has been great for those of you that received the free copy -- we think you'll agree that it's soon to become the leading "must read" publication on market, credit, price and operational risk management in the energy space. 
Also, just a reminder, the charter price for a one year subscription ($199) ends soon. Let us know.
