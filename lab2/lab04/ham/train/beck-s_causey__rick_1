Subject: JOB FUNCTION LIST

In staff meeting today, Rick asked that you help in identifying employees by Job Function.  On this first pass we need each of you to send us a list with the number of employees for each job function.   I have attached a file for you to drop the # of employess into each catagory and a description of the job functions.  This list is needed by Thursday, April 12 at noon.  Please send the list to me and copy Mark Lindsey.

Also, please begin the process of identifying those employees in each Job Function.  This list will be need by Wednesday, April 18.  Once again, please send to me and copy Mark Lindsey.

If you have any questions please call me at x37094 or Mark Lindsey at x31873.
