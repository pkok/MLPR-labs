Subject: Re: Letter to PX Participants


See attached.  The information was taken from Cal PX's schedules.

>>> "Mar, Patricia S."  5/24/2001 8:03:45 AM >>>
Can you provide me ASAP the contact list you used in sending out the
commandeering letter to PX participants.  Alternatively, please provide me
with information as to who at the following companies the letter was
addressed to and sent (these are the clients that we work with):

Avista Energy
Idaho Power
AES New Energy
El Paso Merchant Energy

I'm assuming you used a CalPX list which has contact persons who are not the
same as the people I've been dealing with, and I need to know whose getting
the letter.  Especially since the claim form is apparently pre-filled in
with the names of these people.

Thanks.
