Subject: Transportation to Resort

Please be informed, a mini-bus has been reserved for your convenience in 
transporting you to the Sanibel Harbour Resort from the airport on Wednesday 
afternoon.  Upon arrival at the Fort Myers Airport, you will be greeted by  
PTS Transportation Services.

I have submitted Steve's name as a point of contact.

Have a safe and pleasant flight.
