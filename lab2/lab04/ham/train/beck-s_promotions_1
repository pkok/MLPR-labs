Subject: Revised Promotion Announcement


	

Attached is the promotions announcement that will be distributed to all  
Net Work employees.  Robert would like everyone's sign - off on the 
announcement before it is distributed.  To ensure accuracy, please review and 
let me know if there are any changes before the distribution.

Thanks,
Norma
