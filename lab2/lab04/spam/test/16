The deceased account has been declared dormants since 2006 and these funds will be confiscated/declared unserviceable and turned over to the Hong Kong government if the deceased business associates or next-of-kin did not claim this money; since all efforts to trace any living relative of the deceased proved abortive, i have decided that i will have you claim this money as the

were kept under my care.



Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue,as i hope that you are a sincere,honest,matured person and above all TRUSTWORTHY.Once the funds have been successfully transferred into your account, we shall share it in a ratio of 30% for you,65% for me and my associates in the bank and the reminder 5% to take care of contingencies.
