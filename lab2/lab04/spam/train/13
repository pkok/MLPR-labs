interest to share with you. I got your reference in my search for someone

I am Mr. Patrick K. W. Chan Executive Director &amp; Chief financial Officer

will need you to assist me in executing a business project from Hong Kong

to your country. It involves the transfer of a large sum of money.

Everything concerning this transaction shall be legally done without

hitch. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters

concerning this issue.



Once the funds have been successfully transferred into your account, we

shall share in the ratio to be agreed by both of us



I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below

Please if you are not interested delete this email and do not hunt me
