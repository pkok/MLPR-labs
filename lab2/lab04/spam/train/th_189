How Viagra works?
The penis gets erect during sexual stimulation when increased blood flows    to the penis resulting from relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle.    This is due to the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells    which in turn leads to the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells.
