Greetings,



My name is MRS. Saratu Aziz, widow to late Hassan A. Aziz former owner of Petroleum &amp; Gas Company, here in Kuwait. I am 64years old, suffering from long time Cancer of the breast. From allindications my condition is really deteriorating and it's quite obvious that I won't live more than 2 months according to my doctors. This is because the cancer  stage has gotten to a very bad stage. I dont want your  pity but I need your trust.



My late husband died early last year from Heart attack, and during the period of our marriage we couldn't produce any child. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. The doctor has advised me that I will not live for more than 2 months, so I have now decided to spread all my wealth, to contribute mainly to the development of charity in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. Am sorry if you are embarrassed by my mail. I found your e-mail address in the web directory, and I have decided to contact you, but if for any reason you find this mail offensive, you can ignore it and please accept my apology.



Before my late husband died he was major oil tycoon, in Kuwait and deposited the sum of (Twenty Five million dollars) in a finance company in Europe some years ago, thats all I have left now, I need you To collect this funds and distribute it yourself to charity so that when I die  my soul can rest in peace. The funds will be entirely in your hands and management. I hope God gives you the wisdom to touch very many lives that is my main concern. 30% of this money will be for your time and effort, while 70% goes to charity.





You can get back to me via my private e-mail: mrszainabaziz@aim.com





God bless you.

Mrs.Zainab Saratu Aziz.
